  DESCRIPTION:
  Webhooks allow you to send HTTP requests to external services and APIs. You can make GET requests to fetch data or POST requests to send JSON payloads. Useful for integrating with external services, triggering notifications, or testing APIs.

  AVAILABLE COMMANDS:
  - webhook.get: Send a GET request to fetch data from a URL
    Parameters: {url} (required), {output_file} (optional)
  - webhook.post: Send a POST request with a JSON payload
    Parameters: {url} (required), {payload} (required - JSON string), {output_file} (optional)

  USAGE FORMAT:
  [TOOL_CALL]
  tool_name: webhook
  command_name: get
  parameters:
    url: https://api.github.com/users/github
    output_file: response.txt

  EXAMPLES:
  1. Fetch data: webhook.get with url=https://api.github.com/users/octocat
  2. Send notification: webhook.post with url=https://webhook.site/your-id, payload={"message": "Hello"}

  NOTES:
  - For testing webhooks, use https://webhook.site or https://requestbin.com
